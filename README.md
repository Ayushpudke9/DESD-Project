Real-time data acquisition and analysis of engine performance and vehicle load in heavy vehicles using the CAN (Controller Area Network) protocol involves creating a system that continuously monitors and communicates critical parameters related to the vehicle's operation and condition. Here is a detailed explanation of how such a system can be designed and what functionalities it can include


Key Functionalities of the System
1. Real-Time Engine Performance Monitoring
Parameters such as engine temperature, RPM, fuel consumption, throttle position, and oil pressure are continuously acquired via sensors connected to the CAN bus.
Data is processed to assess engine health, efficiency, and operational status.

2. Vehicle Load Measurement and Analysis
Load sensors or strain gauges measure the weight or stress on the vehicle chassis.
Load data is transmitted over the CAN network to the central ECU.
Real-time load information helps optimize vehicle operation, prevent overloading, and improve fuel efficiency.

3. Leak Detection and Pneumatic System Monitoring
Pressure sensors monitor the pneumatic circuits used in braking and suspension systems.
An algorithm analyzes pressure deviations to detect leaks or faults in the system.
Early detection of leaks helps avoid costly damage and ensures safety.

4. Connection and Condition Monitoring
The system continuously checks the status of electrical connections and sensor health.
Fault detection mechanisms identify loose connections, sensor failures, or damaged wiring.
Diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) can be read and transmitted for maintenance actions.

5. Damage and Fault Alerts
Vibration sensors and other condition monitoring devices detect mechanical damage or unusual vibrations.
The system can trigger alarms or warnings on the dashboard and send notifications via GSM to fleet managers.
This enables proactive maintenance and reduces downtime.

6. Communication and Data Display
Data packets are transmitted as CAN frames between nodes.
The master ECU aggregates data and displays it on an LCD or digital dashboard for the operator.
CAN bus ensures high-speed, reliable communication with error detection and fault tolerance.


7. Remote Monitoring and Fleet Management Integration
Using telematics, data collected via CAN can be sent to cloud servers or fleet management software.
Fleet managers receive real-time insights into vehicle health, driver behavior, fuel efficiency, and compliance.
Remote diagnostics reduce the need for physical inspections and improve operational efficiency.
